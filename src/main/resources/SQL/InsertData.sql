Ben Whately, for instance, tells me about the famous mnemonist Matteo Ricci, a 16th Century Jesuit priest who was the first westerner to take Chinas highest civil service exams. The exam was an excruciating ordeal that involved memorising reams of classical poetry – a task that could take a lifetime. Only 1% of people who took them passed them, yet Ricci passed them after 10 years, having not spoken any Chinese before.Can psychology give us all the same astonishing command of our minds? Thats Whately aim. With former memory champion Ed Cooke, hes already designed a learning app, Memrise, that uses some of the mnemonists principles, as BBC Future has described in the past. Now theyve teamed up with researchers from University College London to launch a competition to find the best possible way to enhance their techniques. Memory experts from across the world were asked to conduct experiments to find the easiest, and most effective, way to memorise new information. Im here to observe the first round of judging. It offers a fascinating exploration of the way our memories work. Whether you are a university student cramming for your finals, or have simply yearned to pick up some tourist French, their insights could take the pain out of digesting facts.',1,false,1);

When the sun is low they hunt the seals by stealth, attacking them from below with such force they sometimes leap clean into the air – a behaviour known as breaching. It is probably the best known behaviour of any shark – and the most spectacular. But as it lasts less than a second and can happen anywhere, it is a real challenge to capture on camera. We had a boat out from first light with both a high speed camera and an ultra HD camera trained on the seals in the hope of catching it. But we also wanted to film this hunt from the air, as it is a perspective that has never been seen before.For an hour every morning a helicopter with a gyro-stabilised camera scoured the sea, looking for groups of seals returning to the islands after feeding in the open ocean. From the air we could also see the dark outline of the sharks as they swam under the surface, waiting for the seals. They did look very ominous. If the shark missed on the first breach then the odds moved in favour of the seal. From the helicopter we could see that the seals strategy was to stay near the tail of the shark and then at the last minute make a dash for safety. The seal was more agile – but the shark more powerful. They made for a well matched pair and it was the most incredible hunt I had ever witnessed.',9,false,1);

If that was the Fight of the Century so far, its a good job there are another 85 years to go. Many people thought Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao would be one-sided. But not that one-sided. Mayweather did what he almost always does in making it look easy, sailing to a wide unanimous decision without much fuss. Evander Holyfield was right: hype alone does not a great fight make. Mayweathers father and trainer, Floyd Sr, said it best: Hes almost too good for his own good. So while the boxing purists were saluting Mayweathers genius, social media was throbbing with people calling him boring. There was even anger, with many feeling they had somehow been cheated. One mans genius is apparently another mans sissy. I thought he ran very well, quipped Pacquiaos trainer Freddie Roach. He was being disingenuous. A seven-time trainer of the year, he recognises greatness. Mayweather didnt even have to unleash all of his weaponry. For most of the fight his jab and right cross sufficed. Only when Pacquiao was a wounded bull in the final few rounds did the American unveil the check hook and uppercut.',6,false,2);

But the danger doesnt come from the perpetual risk of geological disaster. The threat is manmade. Over the past decade, tourism to Isla Ometepe has grown as word of its Eden-like natural beauty has spread. But this dual volcanic island in the middle of Lake Nicaragua, often dubbed a “mini-Amazon”, recently found itself at the centre of a controversial mega-engineering project: a Chinese-run, interoceanic canal that will be deeper and longer than Panamas, ideal for giant cargo ships. The proposed 278km route, connecting the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, will carve through Lake Nicaragua, potentially displacing the surrounding rainforest and threatening indigenous communities. The route will also bring the supertankers right past Ometepes Eden. Work on the canal officially began in December 2014, sparking a wave of protests from those who are worried about losing their homes, and the damage the canal might cause to the environment. Doubts have also been raised over whether there will be enough funding to complete the canal within the allotted five-year plan. The 267sqkm island, home to a population of just under 30,000, receives about 40,000 visitors a year. Between the rough ferry ride over and the islands bone-shaking roads, its understandable that visitor numbers are still relatively low, even with the islands incredible beauty. The next morning, I set off early to kayak on Río Istiam, a river and swamp that cuts inland through the middle of the hourglass-shaped island. On the 3km paddle towards the river mouth, I passed villagers swimming and fishing in the lake. My guide, Maykel Carillo, said locals used to stay out of the water because it was once infested with bull sharks. By the 1980s, overfishing and a shark fin trade wiped-out the population, but some say a few still lurk under the surface. I dipped in my paddle with extra caution. Lake Nicaragua will need to be dredged in order to build a canal thats deep enough for giant cargo ships. “It will kill this lake,” Carillo said. “Many flora and fauna will die.” The local people, most of who are subsistence farmers and rely on fishing, do not have the skills required for the type of jobs the canal will create, Carillo added. “Some have never been to school, so there is no opportunity for them,” he said.',7,false,1);

But what happens to us if the sun never rises? Or if it never sets? Its an annual occurrence for residents who live in or near the Arctic Circle, when summer can bring months of almost constant sun and winter can blend into one long period of darkness. To find out, we turned to question and answer community Quora.com, asking “What is it like to live in places with 24 hours of complete daylight or darkness?” Turns out, respondents found pros and cons to sacrificing the sun or the stars for a few months each year. Living in the light Sai Deepak Bhimaraju, from Delhi, India, found no issue with the constant sunlight when he was in Trondheim, Norway for a two-month summer internship. “Most people I met there had a problem with long days because it messes up their biological clock, but I am from an Indian engineering college!” he explained. “I am used to sleeping during the day and staying awake till breakfast. So, I had no problems having sunlight beaming into my face when I was going to sleep.” His typical routine would be to wake up at noon, work from 2pm to 10pm, have dinner then go on a bike ride in the still-clear light, returning at 1am for a little dessert. “And guess what? Its still not dark!” he said. He did find the Norwegian summer to be cold compared to Delhi, but the constant sun kept him in good spirits. “Sunlight fills you up with so much energy,” Bhimaraju said. “It feels as if youre in paradise, where the lights never go out.” Other Quora respondents found similar joy in the long hours of summer sunlight. Living in the small Swedish town of Kiruna, Garima Pandey shared pictures of the 1am sun still high in the sky. “The blinds werent enough to keep the light out. We had midnight barbecues out in the sun and lost all track of time,” she said. “Our biological cycles (if they existed) went for a toss as the body wasnt used having dinner or sleeping in broad daylight.”',8,false,4);

Husband of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Goldberg was a former Yahoo executive before joining Surveymonkey in 2009. He expanded the online survey company leading to a valuation of $2bn (£1.3bn), the Wall Street Journal says. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described him as "an amazing person". News of Goldbergs death was posted on Facebook by his brother, Robert. "Its with incredible shock and sadness that Im letting our friends and family know that my amazing brother, Dave Goldberg, beloved husband of Sheryl Sandberg, father of two wonderful children, and son of Paula Goldberg, passed away suddenly last night," he wrote. Under Dave Goldberg, SurveyMonkey grew from a handful of employees to more than 450 and acquired 25 million customers. His fortunes was closely linked to those of Silicon Valley - a media company founded by him, Launch Media, was taken over by Yahoo in 2001, just after the "dotcom bubble" burst. In a profile by Business Insider, Goldberg describes how he and a friend started Launch Media, which delivered music online. "I decided I had to start something. It was more the motivation to try running my own thing than because I had some brilliant idea."',5,false,1);

INSERT INTO news.post VALUES (7,'Solarbike is the cycle for sun-lovers','2015-02-10 15:15:00','2015-02-10 15:15:00','Attaching an array of solar cells to an electric bicycle is not an entirely new concept, at least among garage tinkerers. But these DIY contraptions, with expansive photovoltaic panels mounted fore, aft, left, right, overhead and even atop makeshift trailers, look more like interstellar probes than proper two-wheelers. That may soon change. Say hello to the Solarbike. A labour of love for Danish solar-energy engineer Jesper Frausig, the Solarbike is an e-bike prototype that incorporates photovoltaic charging while still managing to look like, well, a normal bike. “Most solar-powered bikes use off-the-shelf components that present design limitations,” says Frausig, who works for Gaia Solar, a solar-energy integration company based outside Copenhagen, where he lives. After studying various concepts, he opted to design the bikes solar panels and battery into the wheels and central frame, respectively. This more integrated design reduces weight and aerodynamic drag, compared with other solar-equipped e-bikes. “My initial observation is that normal [electric] bikes arent that exciting,” notes Frausig, who, like most Denmark residents, is an avid biker. (Government figures show that 90% percent of Danes own bikes and 36% of them pedal to work each day.) “Theyre heavy and not built for young people. “But if you design a lighter electric bike with a sporty design and that is powered by solar energy, suddenly it is something that people get excited about,” he says. “People stop me all the time and ask me what Im riding.” With its battery pack, the Solarbike weighs only about 37lbs – a featherweight compared with typical e-bikes, which can top 70lbs. Of course, as a solar engineer who works for a solar-energy company, Frausig knows a bit more about solar technology than the average DIY solar hacker. “This knowledge allowed me to slowly work toward a concept [bike] with custom-made components instead of off-the-shelf components,” he explains. “And I didnt have to change the basic two-wheel design to make it a solar-powered bike.”',4,false,3);

INSERT INTO news.post VALUES (8,'Lamborghini Veneno: All beast, no bull','2015-02-25 20:10:00','2015-02-25 20:10:00','A tribute to Automobili Lamborghini on the occasion of its 50th birthday, the Veneno is the ultimate party favour. Derived from the overachieving Aventador, the arrow-shaped Veneno pushes the performance envelope even further. The car makes use of the Aventadors mid-mounted 6.5-litre V12, bumped from 700hp to 739hp, and drives all four wheels through a 7-speed automated manual gearbox. Its chassis, featuring an inboard pushrod suspension bolted to a carbon fibre monocoque structure, is pure prototype racer, but Lamborghini is proud to note that the Veneno meets all worldwide road-car safety and registration requirements. Top speed is a breezy 220mph. (For those keeping track, the Aventador is good for 217mph.) The Veneno is a sequel of sorts to the Gallardo-derived, and similarly futuristic, Sesto Elemento show car from 2010. But whereas Lamborghini said it would craft 20 examples of the Sesto Elemento, the automaker plans to build just three Venenos during 2013, priced at a cool 3 million euros each (at writing, about $4.1 million, plus tax). And before you get your hopes up, the company has already found buyers for its triplets, save the one on the Geneva motor show stand – chassis number 0, whose future, to quote Lamborghini, has not been determined yet. As for the name, Veneno, according to the company, was the name of a particularly bad-tempered and fearsomely fast Spanish fighting bull who gained notoriety in 1914 for goring bullfighter José Sánchez Rodríguez to death. A vicious pedigree for a vicious machine.',2,false,1);

But passing through a national park is very different from living on the fringes of one. We reached out to the people who live in the jumping off cities and towns for five of the worlds top national parks – as ranked by US News and World Report and CNN – to get a sense of what its really like to have an incredible natural landscape practically in their backyard. Sedona, United States – Grand Canyon National Park Residents in this small Arizona town, located about 100 miles south of the Grand Canyon, have been known to say: “God made the Grand Canyon, but He lives in Sedona.” The town is also close to six state parks and several national monuments, making it a “great hub for nature enthusiasts”, said Chamber of Commerce president Jennifer Wesselhoff, who moved to Sedona from Switzerland 15 years ago. Sedona also draws residents interested in healing and spirituality. “The area is famous for its vortexes: powerful centres of kinetic energy that can have a deep effect on people,” Wesselhoff said. “Residents experience this red rock energy by hiking, biking, jeeping, or just soaking up the good vibes.” As a result, Wesselhoff said, locals tend to be pretty happy. The neighbourhood of Uptown, stretching along the SR89A highway, attracts residents with its charming bungalows and varied restaurants. And locals flock to west Sedona for the plentiful city parks. But Sedonas laidback vibe doesnt come cheap. The cost of living here is about 40% higher than in the state capital of Phoenix and about 15% higher than in nearby Flagstaff. Arusha, Tanzania – Serengeti National Park Though its the Serengetis safaris that draw most visitors to Arusha, residents of this mid-sized Tanzanian city are equally proud to be so close to the distinct wildlife populations and unique topography found in Tarangire and Ngorongoro national parks. “But Arusha is far more than just the tourism business,” explained British expat Jason Barry, who spent the last four years living in Arusha while working for the nearby Elewana lodges and camps. “Main streets and back streets are littered with workshops, craft houses, furniture makers, hand sign writers, tailors. Within 200 yards of a walk, it is possible to find someone to fix your truck, make you a suit and make you a coffin.” Locals tend to be laid-back and relaxed. “Though friendly, the city has a rough-and-tumble Wild West vibe,” said Africa Adventure Consultants founder Kent Redding, who moved to Arusha from the United States three years ago. Violent crime is rare, but residents are wary of the occasional street crime. Most expats live outside of the city centre, and nearly 40,000 new houses are expected to be built in the next five years. “This will mean new road construction, new shopping malls and all the services that will cater to this new-found middle class,” Barry said. Cusco, Peru – Machu Picchu While known as more of an architectural wonder than a natural one, Machu Picchu has been named a top national parks both for its designation as a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary and because of its rainforest setting on the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains. Cusco, located 75km southeast of Machu Picchu, is a natural home base for the sites never-ending stream of travellers.',10,false,2);
